This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
